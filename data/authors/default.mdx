Hi, I am Razhan, a machine learning engineer. I'm passionate about using machine learning to solve real-world problems. I received my Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Computer Science from the University of Sulaimani, and my Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence from Queen Mary University of London. My research interests include multimodality and the intersection of vision and language. I am interested in explainability and robustness of models.

I am currently building LLMs for low-resource languages. In the past, I have worked on large-scale distributed systems in the telecom and fintech industries. In my previous roles, I was part of a team that built a billing system for a 4G network and built an entire payment gateway from scratch. I have also worked as a Tech advisor for [Five One Labs][1], a startup incubator that helps talented entrepreneurs from conflict-affected areas launch their startups.
